##Setup Trellis and Bedrock##

$ cd /dev

mkdir *foldername* //this will be name of project (ex: hello-world.com)

$ cd *foldername*

Clone Trellis and Bedrock into this directory
Updated links from https://github.com/roots/trellis

$ git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:roots/trellis.git && rm -rf trellis/.git
$ git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:roots/bedrock.git site && rm -rf site/.git

brackets . //this opens folder. 

Inside Trellis you need to edit 2 files to install and create a new wordpress site. 

Go to....
trellis/groups_vars/development/

wordpress_sites.yml 
create domains and test domain

vault.yml
create passwords and link domain

Be very careful to make sure you've linked domains and created passwords correctly. Otherwise Virtual Machine 
or test site may not work and need to start over. Once this is done and you've checked work, make sure Terminal is inside trellis directory

$ cd trellis
$ vagrant up

Will now create virtual machine and go through Ansible playbook. It may ask for password once, can take several minutes to complete. 

Once done, you can go to browser and open new wordpress site in browser, using canonical link you created in .yml files. 

Congrats, now you can create a sage theme or work with existing theme and even deploy. 


## Provision and Deploy Website ##
https://roots.io/trellis/docs/remote-server-setup/

Trellis has two main playbooks: dev.yml and server.yml. As mentioned in local development, Vagrant automatically runs the dev.yml playbook for us.

For remote servers, you provision a server via the server.yml playbook. This leaves you with a server prepared to run a WordPress site, but without the actual codebase yet.
